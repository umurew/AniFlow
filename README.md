# AniFlow
AniFlow is a *ongoing* ***individual*** project. This README file contains information on future updates.

>[!NOTE]
>I am currently upstate (out-of-town) so I would not publish updates for *about a month*.

## Framework
AniFlow uses **.NET 8** which is the *latest version* and also a *long-term* version. I was using .NET Framework but since .NET Framework and .NET Core
were combined into .NET, I had to upgrade my project to .NET 8 due to get **security patches** and **future features**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you will edit or use this project, you have to install **.NET 8 SDK**.
>Also if you will use the release application, you have to install **.NET 8 Runtime**.
>
>Browse all .NET 8 versions of both SDK and Runtime: [Microsoft .NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

## Interface Framework
AniFlow uses *WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)* because WPF has many pros and more advanced & better than WinForms.
I could prefer WinUI 3 for something new but WPF is **more stabilized** and **reliable**. Also I have experience over WPF, so I did not want to risk
projects flow.

## Diskspace & Size
AniFlow is *light-weight* application because it is not much big project. Actually very small compared to other programs.

## Future Updates
I am going to add following updates in future:

- A window to modify library items
- A proper context menu for library items
- Options for settings section
- Themes
