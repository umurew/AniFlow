### About AniFlow
AniFlow is an **individual project** both created and developed by *@umurew*. The purpose of creating AniFlow is to make things easier for people to track where did they
left their favorite movie, series and animes.

### User Interface & User Experience
AniFlow has a clean and easy to understand UI. AniFlow's main window has been split to 3 main parts.

#### 1. Title Bar
The Title Bar is the bar at the top of the window that covers the window from one edge to the other. Title bar also contains:
1. AniFlow Icon
2. Minimize Button
3. Maximize Button
4. Exit Button

#### 2. Navigation Bar
The Navigation Bar is the bar at the left of the window that covers the window from title bar's bottom to the bottom of the window. Navigation bar contains 4 buttons in the latest version. These buttons are:
1. *Navigation Button:* It's used to expand or collapse the navigation bar when clicked. Purpose of this button is to make it easier for you to understand in case if you can't understand the meanings of the navigation buttons by the icons which are on the buttons.
2. *Library Button:* It's used to navigate to library section which contains your movies, series and animes that you just added. Library is also the main-purpose of AniFlow's existence.
3. *Credits Button:* It's used to navigate to credits section which contains a text prepared by *@umurew*. Purpose of this section is to develop the feature to pass to other sections.
4. *Add To Library Button:* It's used to add movies, series and animes to library section. Added items will be shown up in library section.

#### 3. Content Section
Content Section is everywhere left behind navigation bar and title bar. This section is the place where sections like library section and credits section are shown.

### Application Platform
AniFlow is built over *Microsoft's .NET 8*  and which is the latest long-term supported version.
.Net 8 is combined with WPF (Windows Presentation Founder) in order to create AniFlow.
